# Angular ToDo App

Running the project locally:
- Install Angular packages by `npm install`
- Install BE packages in folder `angular-todo-be` by `npm install`
- Run the backend inside `angular-todo-be` with command `npm start`
- Paralelly run the frontend in the root folder with command `npm start`
- In your preferred browser go to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) 
- You can login to the application with credential: `username: admin, password: admin`
- I tried to make the application intuitive, so hopefully no additional information is needed to work with the UI

## Backend
The main goal was to create an Angular application, so I didn't really focus to write a clean code in backend, so please do not have a look at it (I tried to create there something functional as soon as possible).
The backend was done in node.js with no database, the items are saved into a local file.

## Testing
No unit and no e2e tests are found in this project
